# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains explanations, implementations, and code examples of popular algorithms and data structures. Code examples will be based on popular programming languages with an emphasis on JavaScript.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own  README with explanations and links for further reading.

## Space/Time Complexity


## Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

* Arrays
* Strings
* Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Queue
* Stack
* Hash Table
* Linked Hash Map
* Heap
* Priority Queue

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
