# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains examples of many popular algorithms and data structures. Examples will be based in popular programming languages with an emphasis on JavaScript.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

## Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
