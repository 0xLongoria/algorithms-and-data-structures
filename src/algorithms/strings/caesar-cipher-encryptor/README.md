# Caesar Cipher Encryptor  
Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.  
Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter `z` shifted by one returns the letter `a`.  

## Example  
__Sample Input__:  
```
string = "xyz"
key = 2
```
__String Output__:
```
"zab"
```  

## Solution & Complexity  
### Solution 1  
__Strategy__:  
__Complexity__: O( ) Time | O( ) Space  

### Solution 2:  
__Strategy__:  
__Complexity__: O( ) Time | O( ) Space
