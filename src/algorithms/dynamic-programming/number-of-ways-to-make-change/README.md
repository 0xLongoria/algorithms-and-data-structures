# Number Of Ways To Make Change  
Given an array of positive integers representing coin denominations and a single non-negative integer `n` representing a target amount of money, write a function that returns the number of ways to make change for that target amount using the given coin denominations.  
Note that an unlimited amount of coins is at your disposal.

```
n = 6  
denoms = [1, 5]  
```

__Sample Output__:  
```
2 // 1x1 + 1x5 and 6x1  
```
